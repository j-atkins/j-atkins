## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher working in the [OceanParcels](https://oceanparcels.org/) group at Utrecht University, specifically on the [VirtualShip](https://virtualship.oceanparcels.org/) project. This tool is used to give students experience similar to sea-going fieldwork, analyse ocean data and also provides a platform for scientists to plan their future research. I focus on developing the Python code base.
